### Summary

This application is the second full-stack application I have created and the first one that has full CRUD operations with an external databse. The backend is designed to handle the internal API route requests from the client, pass those along to a handler, which passes those to a service to make the external database requests. 

To create this application, I had to learn some new technologies. I learned SQL/PostgreSQL for the external database. This was also the first application in which I implemented authentication/authorization, so I learned how to utilize JSON Webtoken to handle that. Additionally, this project allowed me to continue learning and get more experience working with Nodejs/Express and consuming external APIs. 

This project certainly pushed me to hone my skills as a self-taught devloper. Thinking and working through problems was a major theme of this project. I got more experience reading documentation and searching for solutions to problems in order to get the application created and deployed. This was an extremely rewarding experience, and I look forward to taking the skills that I learned and honed on this project to others in the future.
